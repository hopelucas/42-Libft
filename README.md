# 42-libft

A repository containing the first project, Libft, from the 42 school. I scored 125/100 and passed all 3 testers, no memory overflows and all files protected. Norminette says everything's fine! Feel free to use my code to help build your own library. :) Make sure when you use "make" you take out libft.a and the .o files when you're done!

I've kept it as-is as opposed to organising my files by type so that you can see what the project should look like on submission, assuming you're following my files to a t. You should find this passes all testers if it's cloned correctly, but check out my notes to demonstrate how I did what I did, or email me if you need an explanation. Some decisions I've made in my code were more for the sake of time, and less about fluidity - in future projects, you'll see this come into play a LOT more (I become more confident and write more and more of what looks like C code shorthand).

Fits norminette standard as of 18/11/2021!
