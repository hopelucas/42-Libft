# 42-libft

A repository containing the first project, Libft, from the 42 school. I scored 125/100 and passed all 3 testers, no memory overflows and all files protected. Norminette says everything's fine! Feel free to use my code to help build your own library. :) Make sure when you use "make" you take out libft.a and the .o files when you're done!

I've kept it as-is as opposed to organising my files by type so that you can see what the project should look like on submission.
